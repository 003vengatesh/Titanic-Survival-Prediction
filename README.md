# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢⚓️

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project repository! This project focuses on predicting survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction ℹ️

This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset and build predictive models to determine which passengers were likely to survive the tragic sinking of the Titanic. Aspiring Data Scientists will find this project informative for learning data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and evaluation.

## Dataset 📊

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, including features such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare, and survival status.

## Dependencies 🛠️

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your environment:
- pandas==1.3.3
- numpy==1.21.2
- seaborn==0.11.2
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- scikit-learn==0.24.2

You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Project Structure 📁

The project consists of the following components:
- Importing Libraries
- Loading Dataset
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Selection
- Model Evaluation
- Model Comparison
- Final Model Selection

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb` to follow along with the project.
4. Explore, modify, and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding and skills.

## Model Selection 🤖

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for this project:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes

Based on the evaluation metrics, the Random Forest Classifier was selected as the final model due to its superior performance.
